		<h1>Title</h1>
		<h2>What is a Title Insurance?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
			  You’re probably familiar with homeowner’s insurance – it protects you against the possibility of future events such as fire or flood. 
			  Title insurance is similar in that it protects your home investment, but it protects you against loss from defects that already exist 
			  in the title, should your legal rights to your property be challenged. Those hazards could include outstanding mortgages, liens, 
			  easements or pending legal action.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  The process of getting title insurance starts with a search of property records to eliminate risk and uncover any title defects before 
			  issuing insurance. If any defects are found, your title company would work to correct them whenever possible. Then upon closing, you would 
			  be issued a ‘clean title’ to the property.
			 </p>
			 
			 <p>
			  However, even with the best searches, hidden hazards (such as a forged signature or an unknown heir) 
			  can pop up after closing. That’s when title insurance comes into play, to protect you as long as you have a financial interest in the insured 
			  property. The title insurer pays for defending against an attack on your title as insured, and will either perfect the title or pay valid claims.
			</p>
		</div>
		
			<h2>What Types of Title Insurance Are There?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>There are Two Types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lenders Policy- The lender's policy protects the lender's interest in the property for the amount of the mortgage loan.</li><br>
				<li>Owners Policy- An owner's policy protects the home buyer's interest in the property against such hidden hazards as:<br><br>
					<ul>
					<li>Mistakes in recording of legal documents</li>
					<li>Forged deeds, releases, or wills</li>
					<li>Undisclosed or missing heirs, including spouses</li>
					<li>Deeds by minors</li>
                    <li>Liens for unpaid taxes</li>
					</ul></li>		
			</ul>
		</div>
		
			<h2>How Long Does Title Insurance Last?</h2>
		<div>
		    <p> 
		      A lender's policy lasts until the mortgage is paid in full.  An owner's policy remains in force as long as you or 
			  your heirs have an interest in the property.
            </p>
            
            <p>			
			  If challenges to title arise after the property has passed to your heirs, 
			  the title insurance company would defend the title for them as it would for you.
		    </p>
		</div>
			
			<h2>What is a Title Search?</h2>
		<div>
		    <p> 
		      It is a detailed examination of all available public records on a property to verify the seller's right to transfer ownership 
			  and to uncover any potential challenges you might face.  A title search should reveal such things as unpaid taxes, unsatisfied 
			  mortgages, and judgments against the seller.
			 </p>
			 
			 <p> 
			  However, even the diligent search may fail to reveal some hidden hazards, such as 
			  those mentioned earlier, and that is when title insurance comes into play.  
		    </p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>How long does a Title Search take?</h2>
		<div>
		    <p> 
		      A title company examiner searches the records of the county recorder, county assessor, and other government taxing agencies to locate any 
			  documents which might affect the title to a given property. 
			</p>
			
			<p>			
			  Depending on the number of documents the examiner must review, a title search 
			  will take anywhere from one hour to two weeks to complete. Read this search carefully and look for any hidden problems.  
		    </p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Who determines the title insurance rates and fees?</h2>
		<div>
		    <p> 
		      Buyers and sellers often accept these charges without question, accepting the fees as set forth by the title company or closing agent. 
			  But title insurance fees are not all alike. The fees may vary from state to state, and may not be set by law in every state. In many states, 
			  each title company may set its own rates and then will file those fees with the state insurance commissioner. 
			</p>  
			 
            <p>			 
			  Once filed, those fees must be adhered to. The key is to ask at the beginning of your escrow what the charge will be, and if your closing agent is charging the lowest rate 
			  allowed by state law. Many title companies combine the title insurance premium together with the closing, search and exam fees. 
		    </p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Is title insurance required by law?</h2>
		<div>
		    <p> 
		      Title insurance is not required by law, however almost all lenders will require a lender's title insurance policy as a condition of making their 
			  loan to protect their interests.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  In addition, buyers should always insist upon an owner's title policy to protect their equity in the property. 
			  Local custom often dictates who pays for the policy of title insurance, although this may be a negotiable item in your closing.
		    </p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>What are clouds on a title?</h2>
		<div>
		    <p> 
		      Clouds are liens or judgments on a title. A lien is a claim to property for the payment of a debt, and the lien holder could foreclose on the 
			  property if the debt is not paid off. 
			</p>  
			
			<p>
			  Liens can generally be removed by the payment of the amount owed. This payment can occur before the 
			  closing takes place, or at the time of closing. 
		    </p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>When do I recieve a copy of the deed to the property?</h2>
		<div>
		    <p> 
		      The deed will be mailed to the buyer from the recorder's office after it has been documented (recorded) in the county official records.
		    </p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>How often are title policy premiums paid?</h2>
		<div>
		    <p> 
		      You only pay once, at time of closing.
		    </p>
		</div>

	    <h1>Escrow</h1>
		<h2>What is a Escrow?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
			  The technical definition of an escrow is, "A transaction where one party engages in the sale, transfer, or lease of real or personal property 
			  with another person who delivers a written instrument, money or other items of value to a neutral third person, called an escrow agent."  
			  An escrow agent serves as an impartial holding area. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  Duties includes receiving funds and documents necessary to comply with those instructions, completing or obtaining required forms, and handling 
			  final delivery of all items to the proper parties upon successful completion of the escrow.
			</p> 
		</div>
		
			<h2>What does opening an Escrow mean?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
			  Opening escrow simply means starting the closing process by visiting the office of the escrow company, then handing over the deposit money and 
			  giving instructions for the transaction. 
			</p>

			<p>
			  Anyone who is involved in the transaction may "open escrow." Generally, the real estate agent takes the 
			  initiative and opens the escrow. In for-sale-by-owner transactions, in which no agent is involved, either the buyer or the seller or both together 
			  may open escrow.
			</p>
			
		</div>
		
			<h2>Who sets the closing date?</h2>
		<div>
		    <p> 
		      Either buyer or seller, though both parties must agree to the date. Generally the buyer puts his request for a 30, 60 or 90 day escrow in the 
			  original purchase agreement. The seller may request a shorter or longer escrow, depending on his circumstances, and as long as the buyer agrees, 
			  that date will be set. 
			 </p>
			  
			  <p>
			  Generally, a "financing contingency" is put into the offer to purchase in which the buyer is given a specified amount of 
			  time to obtain a mortgage. Once the buyer has a firm commitment from a lender, the actual closing date can usually be set. If you are the buyer, 
			  make sure the closing date is prior to the expiration of your lender's loan commitment or lock-in date for your interest rate. 
		    </p>
		</div>
			
			<h2>What are closing cost and how much do they cost?</h2>
		<div>
		    <p> 
		      Closing costs usually come out to between 4 and 5 percent of your purchase price. The closing costs will include title searches, government taxes,
			  notary fees, loan fees, escrow fees, recording fees, re-conveyance fees, prorations and sales commissions.
		    </p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>What happens on the day of closing?</h2>
		<div>
		    <p> 
		      Closing is the day in which the deed is exchanged for the sales proceeds money. The buyer deposits any remaining money due into escrow and 
			  signs his escrow and loan documents; and the seller will sign the deed and closing statements and receive a check for the money due to him.
			</p>

			<p>	
			  "Recording" will take place on that day, which means that the deed and any mortgage documents are taken to the county court house and recorded 
			  in the official records. These documents are then made of "public record" for anyone to see.
		    </p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>When Can I Move in?</h2>
		<div>
		    <p> 
		      The actual day that you can move in will be determined by local practice and the terms of your purchase agreement. It may be the day of closing,
			  or it may be a day or two after the closing. 
		    </p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Do I have to have Escrow?</h2>
		<div>
		    <p> 
		      Some lenders allow you to pay your own property taxes and home insurance premiums, especially if your loan-to-value ratio is below 80 percent. 
			  But don't be surprised if the lender boosts your interest rate to compensate for the additional risk it is assuming.
		    </p>
			
			<p>
			  Once an escrow requirement is in place, it can be difficult to persuade a lender to cancel it. If your loan is sold, as is common, and there is 
			  nothing in the lending agreement that provides for cancellation of the escrow requirement, you'll have to live with the decision of your new 
			  mortgage servicer.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Who can hold escrows?</h2>
		<div>
		    <p> 
		     The escrow holder may be any disinterested third party (although some states require that certain escrow holders be licensed). There are two 
			 important reasons for selecting an established, independent escrow firm or title insurance company such as Saratoga Title & Escrow.
			</p>

			<p>
			 One is that real estate transactions require a tremendous amount of technical experience and knowledge. The other is that the escrow holder will 
			 generally be responsible for safe-guarding and properly distributing the purchase price.
		    </p>
