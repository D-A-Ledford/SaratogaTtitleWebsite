	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great customer service! Settlement done in a timely manner and everything was clearly explained to me. Staff was knowledgeable and 
	respectful. Received my tittle in the mail. Thank you!!<br>
	-Gregg Johnson-</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great company.  My amazing realtor and my excellent mortgage lender have worked with this company in the past, 
	and they recommended Saratoga Title.  I'm glad they did.</p>
	
	<p>Everything was handled with efficiency and professionalism -- and a nice friendly touch (including coffee, sodas, and light 
	snacks in the waiting area).  Knowing that this is a stressful day for people, it was really a relief to have them take care of 
	everything quickly and smoothly.<br>
	-Judy Smith-</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife and I closed on a wonderful single family home yesterday, and Saratogat Title $ Escrow made the process extremely smooth, 
	easy to understand and we had fun in the process. Yes, I am talking about fun during a real estate closing! Sid and his staff have a great 
	sense of humor, and are super efficient.<br>
