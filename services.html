		<p>
		When a piece of property changes hands, agreeing on a price is just the first step in a long journey. Next there are many legal documents 
		that must be prepared and agreed to in order for the transaction to go forward. As a title and escrow company, Saratoga Title & Escrow acts as legal 
		counsel on behalf of our client, whether a homebuyer/seller, lender, or real estate agent.  There are two main services we provide:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Title services ensure a clear legal ownership, tracing the property’s history to make sure all possible claims of ownership and any inconsistencies 
			have been addressed and resolved, and offering insurance that your title is clear.</li><br>
			
			<li>Escrow services provide a neutral "holding area" for funds to be transferred until all the legalities have been cleared.</li>
		</ul><br>

		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part of the closing process is to understand that you have a choice in title companies. And choosing a title company can be as important as

		Title & Escrow.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take our responsibility to facilitate and protect the single largest financial transaction of your life seriously. Through open communication and 
		constant accessibility we will help you understand the closing process, what you’re signing, and why it’s needed. And, we keep you in the loop so you 
		know what’s happening at every stage of the process.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goals are to give you the knowledge you need to close with confidence and feel protected in the long term; and to make the process as convenient 
		as possible. Just tell your REALTOR you want Saratoga Title & Escrow.
