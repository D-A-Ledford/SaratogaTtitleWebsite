	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saratoga Title & Escrow, Inc. is truly a home grown business finding its strength in employees that have been part of the area community since youth.  
	Opened as Saratoga Title Agency in 1987, the name was changed in 1998 to better reflect the line of full service title research, title insurance 
	and settlement services provided by the company.
	</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have offered title and settlement services to the area since inception and from our present 
	location since 1999. Every business touts experience but at Saratoga Title experience is a given. Stability is the key to delivering real estate 
	closings with efficiency and accuracy.</p>  

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core staff members have been with us since the doors opened. As the business grew new employees joined our 
	team and have been with us since. Everyone at Saratoga Title is dedicated to making your real estate settlement 
	an educational and pleasant experience.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an independently owned and operated company we are not subjected to policies and regulations put in place by an outside group 
	or board members who do not have their finger on the pulse of the needs of our clients. This allows us to give our clients a personal 
	touch and readily<br> adapt to their individual needs while providing a friendly and professional environment throughout the settlement process.</p>
